## Online Questions and Discussion
We will use Piazza for all online discussions related to this course.  Our
Piazza url https://piazza.com/hawaii/spring2017/math480/home 

Students will receive an email during the first week of classes with an
invitation to join our Piazza site.


## General Expectations
The Department of Mathematics has a [general expectations statement](http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~dale/Expectations.html), which we will follow in this class.

## Course Objective
This is a class directed to Math majors who are close to their graduation. 
The primary goal of the class is to develop mathematics reading, writing, and
presentation skills of the students.  
This includes  written and oral communication skills---specifically,
mathematical communication---as well as
mathematical presentation skills.  Students will learn to use technologies such as 
LaTeX for writing mathematics, and the LaTeX "beamer" document class for
presentations.  

(PowerPoint is not recommended, but may be used with special
permission from the instructor.  I know *very little* about Microsoft Powerpoint
and other proprietary presentation making software. While those who use them may
achieve quite impressive outcomes, I cannot be of any assistance with these
technologies.)

Plenty of information about the technologies used in this class, such as
LaTeX and Github, will be provided to the students once the class begins.

This is a **mathematics** class which is designated to have an **oral focus**. 
As a consequence, various types of oral mathematical presentations is a  subject
of emphasis.

## Grading Policy

Math 480 is offered only as a CR/NC class.  Students cannot pass the class
without completing the following to the satisfaction of the instructor: 

+ attending all classes and regularly participating in class discussions;</li>
+ presenting solutions to homework assignments four times during the semester
(oral presentations);
+ taking the mathematics department assessment exam at the end of the semester

## Course Content

In this class, we focus on **presentations**. Every student will give four 
presentations over the course of the semester.  

+ **General.** Every student prepares and delivers a 5 minute talk in which they
present answers to the following:
"Why have I chosen Mathematical major?  What do I love
about math?  What is math good for?" 

+ **Short specific mathematical presentations.** 
Every student prepares and delivers a 10 minute talk on his/her favorite theorem.

+ **Short general mathematical presentations.** Every student prepares and
  delivers a 10 minute talk on an area or a notion of contemporary mathematics
  on his/her choice.

Students should ask the instructor for some guidance when choosing a topic. 
As a start, below is a list of [suggested topic areas](#suggested-topic-areas). 
Students are advised to focus on a small, special part of one of the areas.


+ **Medium length mathematical presentations.** Every student prepares and
delivers a 20 minute talk which is supposed to be an expanded version of one of
his/her previous short mathematical presentations.

+ **Write-up** Finally, the medium length presentation must be written up as a
mathematical paper using the LaTeX document preparation system,
and distributed by the student using github and soliciting feedback from at
least one other student.

Besides the above, there will be some presentations, both mathematical and
industry-related, given by invited professionals.

Assessment exam will be given towards the end of the semester as a part of the classwork.

## Suggested Topic Areas

+ set theory 
+ logic or proof theory
+ computability (recursion theory)
+ general (universal) algebra
+ lattice theory
+ group theory or ring theory or field theory
+ linear (vector) spaces or spectral theory
+ complex analysis
+ differential equations
+ probability or statistics
+ (point-set or algebraic) topology
+ Fourier (harmonic) analysis or wavelets
+ lambda calculus or type theory
